# MA3

## Group Assignment

This is a group assignment (state the name of your group clearly!). You submit just one shared assignment per group, but every student should give feedback.

In this MA, you should make the following:

* **Base Design:** Design the base for the line following robot (in Fusion360 or other CAD software). The base will be manufactured by laser cutting and you need to cut it. The base will hold the motors, motor holders, the battery pack, the Arduino and, breadboard, the infrared sensors to detect the line and the gripper (only for 3 person groups, leave some holes to attach it). There are several ways to design it. Think in the functionality and be original. Please, avoid rectangular bases (they are boring). Take into account that most of the weight of the robot (battery holder, Arduino, breadboard) should be placed next to the motors. That weight will generate traction to the wheels. If a lot of weight is placed far away from the motors, you risk that the motors and wheels spin but do not move your robot forward.

* **Laser Cutting:** Laser cut the base. You must do it, but you can upload the assignment before cutting it as the laser cutting needs supervision. Do not delay the assignment to wait for a time to laser cut.

* **Wheel Design:** Design of the wheels for the robot (or modify the ones from last week). You need to design and 3D print or laser cut them (or find some commercial wheels).

* **Robot Assembly:** Create an assembly of the robot (consider reusing the assembly made for MA2). This assembly needs to contain the base, motor holders and motors. However, it is better if you also place the Arduino, battery pack, breadboard and the sensors. If you do not place them, think where they be placed later. If you do not have their models, you could check in Thingiverse or other websites to find them (or similar models).

* **Technical Drawing:** A technical drawing with the basic dimensions of the robot (the drawing of the assembly that you have made).

You must upload a file or a link to the assembly of the robot AND a PDF file with pictures of (1) the design of the base in CAD, (2) the manufactured base (laser cut) if possible, and (3) the technical drawing with the basic dimensions of the robot assembly with wheels.

**Note:** It is not a requirement, but you should manufacture the wheels and assemble the robot when you have time. The physical robot needs to be assembled by lecture/exercise 6.
