## 1. Base Design

Below you can see the base design.
Our first goal was to have space enough for the motors, motor holders, the battery pack, the Arduino, the breadboard, and a front wheel.
The second goal was to have a design which looked slightly like a nuke.

## 2. Laser Cutting

We unfortunately did not have time to laser cut the base.
But you can see the design above.

## 3. Wheel Design

The rear wheels are the same as in MA2:

We wanted to have fun with the front wheel, se we designed it as a drum wheel:
