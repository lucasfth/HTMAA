This is a group assignment (you submit just one assignment per group), but every student should give feedback.

In this MA, you should do the following:

  Choose a picture of a machine (or even better, several pictures) where you can see its mechanisms (gears, bearings, linkages, motors, joints, etc.) The machine could be a 3D printer, a robot, a milling machine, a crane, a microscope, or whatever you find interesting. The task is to describe how it works and its main components (20-30 lines max.). Please, use arrows and text on the picture to identify the components and degrees of motion.

  Design a mechanism in Fusion 360 (or another CAD program) and add joints (revolute, prismatic, etc.) to the mechanism.

Note: If you are a group of 3 members, the mechanism needs to be (1) a gripper for the robot, which should be able to grasp a soda can using servomotor, or (2) a reduction for the wheels. Groups of 3 persons must build it and provide a picture of the built mechanism, but it does not need to be placed on the robot base (installing the mechanism on the front of the robot is optional).

You need to upload a link to a video (or some snapshots) of the mechanism in different configurations in a CAD program and a PDF file with the picture (or several pictures) of the machine or mechanism described and the text describing how it works.
