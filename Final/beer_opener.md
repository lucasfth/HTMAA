# Beer Opener

## Force calculations

For m/s

- $\text{circumference} = (2*\pi*r)$
- $\text{rev per sec} = (rpm/60*\text{reduction ratio})$
- $\text{linear speed} = \text{circumference} * \text{rev per sec}$
- $\text{momentum} = \text{mass} * \text{linear speed}$

For a the initial setup this would have been:

$$
    \text{circumference} = 2 * \pi * 0,1m \approx 0,63m \\
    \text{rev per sec} = 109/60 * 4,5 \approx 8,175 rev/s \\
    \text{linear speed} = 0,63m * 8,175 rev/s \approx 5,15 m/s \\
    \text{momentum} = 0,3kg * 5,15 m/s \approx 1,55 J
$$

For the setup with a 1000rpm motor it would be:

$$
    \text{circumference} = 2 * \pi * 0,1m \approx 0,63m \\
    \text{rev per sec} = 1000/60 * 4,5 \approx 75 rev/s \\
    \text{linear speed} = 0,63m * 75 rev/s \approx 47,25 m/s \\
    \text{momentum} = 0,3kg * 47,25 m/s \approx 14,175 J
$$

## Measurements of components

### Ball bearings

12.5mm in diameter
6mm in width

### Cord

4mm in diameter

### DC Motor

4mm in diameter
3.2mm from the flat side to the other side

### Supporting rod

Will be used to support the wheel arms and go down into the base.

8mm in diameter

### Wheel infinity screw

The infinity screw will be inserted into the big wheel.
To ensure they do not fall out the idea is to have two hex nuts inside the wheel, so that it will be screwed in place.
They can also be on each side of the wheel.

5.5mm in diameter

#### Wheel infinity screw hex nut

10mm in diameter

### Big ball bearing

The big ball bearings will be used to support the big wheel.

21.5mm in outer diameter
7.5mm in inner diameter
6.8mm in width

### Force to uncap beer
